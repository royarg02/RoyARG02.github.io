        <h2 class="heading">Trying my luck at <em>actual</em> blogging</h2>
        <p class="para">1 Mar 2022</p>
        <p class="para">
          I had been meaning to make this website something <em>more than</em> just displaying my
          portfolio, and as of last year, planning to add blogs to this site itself.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          That "planning" started with a re-write of all <code>CSS</code> classes this website used,
          which depended heavily on the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element. This work was completed only
          <a href="https://github.com/RoyARG02/RoyARG02.github.io/commit/864d7ea74ecf78601cf938db971983ed67a4e4d8" target="_blank">yesterday</a>,
          as of writing this blog.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          It will also relieve me of my <a href="https://royarg.medium.com" target="_blank">Medium</a> account.
          I plan to move my (updated)articles here, as I am cutting down on the number of my online accounts
          <em>(I would lose my "SEO privileges" by doing that, which I couldn't care less)</em>.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subheading">Other than that, these are what I expect to do with blogs:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>All blogs in one place</strong>: As the number of blogs increases, the <a href="../index.html" target="_blank">main&nbsp;page</a>
            will update to instead link to an index of these blogs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>More frequent blogs</strong>: These "blogs" would be "blogs" and not "articles" and probably
            won't exceed the viewport of a typical 1080p window. So think of the same length as of a Twitter thread.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Automatically generated blogs(with tags)</strong>: <em>All</em> pages on this site are hand-written
            directly on <code>HTML</code>, which is why the blogs won't be long, and migration of the Medium
            articles will take a while. But it would be nice to have these pages automatically generated. I expect this task to take
            the longest time as I evaluate solutions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para">
          In any case, at least this would be something that increases the commit count of
          <a href="https://github.com/RoyARG02/RoyARG02.github.io/">my website</a> :)
