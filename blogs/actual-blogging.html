      <h2 class="heading">Trying my luck at <em>actual</em> blogging</h2>
      <p class="para">1 Mar 2022</p>
      <p class="para">
        I had been meaning to make this website something <em>more than</em> just displaying my
        portfolio, and as of last year, planning to add blogs to this site itself.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        That "planning" started with a re-write of all <code>CSS</code> classes this website used,
        which depended heavily on the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element. This work was completed only
        <a href="https://github.com/RoyARG02/RoyARG02.github.io/commit/864d7ea74ecf78601cf938db971983ed67a4e4d8" target="blank">yesterday</a>,
        as of writing this blog.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        It will also relieve me of my <a href="https://royarg.medium.com" target="blank">Medium</a> account.
        I plan to move my (updated)articles here, as I am cutting down on the number of my online accounts
        <em>(I would lose my "SEO privileges" by doing that, but who cares)</em>.
      </p>
      <h3 class="subheading">Other than that, these are what I expect to do with blogs:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>All blogs in one place</strong>: As the number of blogs increases, the <a href="../index.html" target="blank">main&nbsp;page</a>
          will update to instead link to an index of these blogs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>More frequent blogs</strong>: These "blogs" would be "blogs" and not "articles" and probably
          won't exceed the viewport of a typical 1080p window. So think of the same length as of a Twitter thread.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Automatically generated blogs(with tags)</strong>: <em>All</em> pages on this site are hand-written
          directly on <code>HTML</code>, which is why the blogs won't be long, and migration of the Medium
          articles will take a while. But it would be nice to have these pages automatically generated. I expect this task to take
          the longest time as I evaluate solutions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="para">
        In any case, at least this would be something that increases the commit count of
        <a href="https://github.com/RoyARG02/RoyARG02.github.io/">my website</a> :)
