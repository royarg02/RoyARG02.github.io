[Portfolio Website][1]

## Motivation

During early 2020, I tried to use **Flutter Web** to make a _"Web-only"_ Flutter
project. Initial implementations were unsatisfying though, as it was still in
beta, and lacked some features; [proper handling of mouse scrolling, for
instance][2].

So I switched to HTML and CSS instead.

Subsequently I began to include blogs to this website, and it quickly occured to
me that managing HTML elements for ~ 200 lines was not fun. I also planned to
migrate blogs then written over at Medium, and wrangling the elements for
those blogs having word counts of >3000 would have been even worse.

So I then migrated to Hugo, with a [theme built from scratch][4].
