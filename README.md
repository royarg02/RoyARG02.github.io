## Motivation

During early 2020, I tried to use **Flutter Web** to make a _"Web-only"_ Flutter project. Initial implementations were unsatisfying though, as it was still in beta, and lacked some features; proper handling of mouse scrolling, for instance. (I'm sure Flutter web is much better now).

So I switched to HTML and CSS instead.

I tried to make it visually similar to, if I someday make up my mind to build it, the Flutter web version, but I took some liberty in giving it its flavour.
