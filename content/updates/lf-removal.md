The package [`lf-royarg-bin`][1] was brought in [`royarg-repo`][2] due to
official packages lacking a proper `.desktop` file, even though it was available
[upstream][3]. That file is required to use `lf` as a default file manager.

Since then the `.desktop` file is being included in official packages, making
this unofficial package useless.

Following [deprecation][4] which rendered this into an empty package, it has now
been dropped from `royarg-repo`.

To continue using `lf` install the package from [official ArchLinux repositories][5].
