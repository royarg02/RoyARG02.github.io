Hi, I'm Anurag. I'm an electronics graduate with a immense interest in building
open-source software.

I'm currently submitting the occasional [patch][1] to the Flutter SDK,
[tweaking][2] my dotfiles, planning to rewrite this website next year with
another framework and working to make my Linux exprerience [lightweight][3] and
[suck][4] a bit [less][5].

## Work

- [Contributions to `flutter/flutter`][6] on GitHub.
- [Soif][7] with [Aritra Roy Gosthipaty][8], [Ayush Thakur][9] and [Snehangshu Bhattacharya][10]
  : An automated drip irrigation system and weather monitoring(soil moisture,
  illuminance, temperature and humidity) system built primarily using an
  ESP8266. Accompanied by a mobile application which works along with a MongoDB
  database through [REST API][11].
- IoT Based Surveillance System with [Ankan Chattapadhyay][12], [Chandril Mukherjee][13] and [Suman Purkait][14]
  : A surveillance system powered by Raspberry Pi 3B+ which uses a single shot
  detection model for efficient utilization of bandwith and storage.
  Accompanied by a mobile application providing controls, notifications of
  detection and access to recorded footage.
- [This website][15]
  : This website originally was meant to be built on [Flutter Web][16], but
  [unsatifying results back then][17] made me switch to HTML + CSS instead.
  Later, to make blogging more about putting words and not about managing HTML
  elements, I moved to [Hugo][18].
- [`royarg-repo`][19]
  : An [Arch Linux][20] unofficial repository hosting custom packages of known
  software, which I use daily on my Linux machine. Building and deploying of
  packages are done using [Github Actions][21].
