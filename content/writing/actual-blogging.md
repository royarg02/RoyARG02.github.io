I had been meaning to make this website something _more than_ just displaying my
portfolio, and as of last year, planning to add blogs to this site itself.

That "planning" started with a re-write of all `CSS` classes this website used,
which depended heavily on the `<section>` element. This work was completed only
[yesterday][1], as of writing this blog.

It will also relieve me of my [Medium][2] account. I plan to move my
(updated)articles here, as I am cutting down on the number of my online accounts
_(I would lose my "SEO privileges" by doing that, which I couldn't care less)_.

**Other than that, these are what I expect to do with blogs:**

- **All blogs in one place**: As the number of blogs increases, the [main page][3]
will update to instead link to an index of these blogs.
- **More frequent blogs**: These "blogs" would be "blogs" and not "articles" and
probably won't exceed the viewport of a typical 1080p window. So think of the
same length as of a Twitter thread.
- **Automatically generated blogs(with tags)**: _All_ pages on this site are
hand-written directly on `HTML`, which is why the blogs won't be long, and
migration of the Medium articles will take a while. But it would be nice to have
these pages automatically generated. I expect this task to take the longest time
as I evaluate solutions.

In any case, at least this would be something that increases the commit count of
[my website][4] :)
